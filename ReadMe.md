Slack.py by Wilson Le

I am going to launch slack, log in, and send a message

I first find the domain input, clear the input, and type the server name
Then I am going to find the login button and click it

Then I am going to find the username field, and put my username
Then I am going to find the password field, and put in my password
I am then going to find the login button and click it

I then find the text field, and type the message and click enter.
